    <title>Filling a gap</title>
    <para>
      Any Java programmer will, at any given time, face the need to execute remote HTTP requests. Google will most
      likely point you to <ulink url="http://hc.apache.org/httpclient-3.x/">Apache HttpClient</ulink> or some other
      cheesy implementation based on JDK's URLConnection.
    </para>
    <para>
      While these clients are fine for your trivial example and maybe even for you simple client application that just
      need to perform a couple of requests every now and then, you'll quickly discover that they don't scale when the
      number of requests rises above the four digit figures.
    </para>
    <para>
      <ulink url="&Home;">hotpotato</ulink> is not your traditional Java HTTP client. Its purpose is not to become
      yet-another-simple-HTTP-client but rather a performance-focused tool that is able to eat the gobs of requests you
      throw at it to perform... And ask for more.
    </para>
    <para>
      It was initially thought as a "server-side" HTTP client, kind of like a proxy to remote HTTP services that could
      handle thousands of concurrent requests as fast as possible, consuming as little resources as possible.
