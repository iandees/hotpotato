/**
 * A simpler and friendlier interface to execute HTTP requests.
 * <p/>
 * The {@code HttpSession} interface aims to simplify the usage of a {@link com.biasedbit.hotpotato.client.HttpClient} by
 * allowing requests to be passed as a full URL (e.g. http://hotpotato.biasedbit.com) rather than split by host, port
 * and URI (like {@link com.biasedbit.hotpotato.client.HttpClient} does.
 * <p/>
 * It also offers other handy utilities like automated redirect, authorization and proxy handling for both HTTP 1.0
 * and HTTP 1.1.
 *
 * <h2>Relation to HttpClient</h2>
 * A {@code HttpSession} can be seen as a context in which several requests are executed, such as a session for a given
 * user account to a site or even as a browser tab.
 * <p/>
 * The {@code HttpSession} relies on a underlying {@link com.biasedbit.hotpotato.client.HttpClient} to manage the request
 * execution itself, so you will still need to configure and provide this implementation when creating a new session.
 * <p/>
 * Thus, the focus of implementations of this class is merely to automate some of the most boring tasks such as
 * decomposing URLs in the format 'http://host:port/uri' to something that
 * {@link com.biasedbit.hotpotato.client.HttpClient} likes, as well as adding necessary headers when sending request in
 * HTTP 1.1 or even when going through a proxy. Other repetitive tasks can also be automated using this interface.
 *
 * <h2>Automating response behaviors</h2>
 * Automated response handling can be achieved by plugging in {@link ResponseCodeHandler}s. These handlers intercept
 * responses and perform either some computation or another subsequent request (like authorization or redirect
 * handling).
 * <p/>
 * For more information, check the documentation for {@link ResponseCodeHandler}.
 *
 * <h2>Automated cookie storage</h2>
 * By default, no cookies are stored, leaving it to the programmer to manually handle cookie management. If you want to
 * store all cookies received by requests executed using a specific session, you have to manually add a
 * {@link com.biasedbit.hotpotato.session.handler.CookieStoringResponseHandler} using the method
 * {@link #addHandler(ResponseCodeHandler)}.
 * <p/>
 * Example:
 * <pre>
 * HttpSession session = ...;
 * session.addHandler(new CookieStoringResponseHandler());
 * </pre>
